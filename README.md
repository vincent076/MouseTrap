How does it work?

Every 'hyperlink' that appears on your Facebook newsfeed will be analyzed. After this an algorithm does a prediction if the content is a clickbait or not.

The more ðŸ§€ you see, the higher the chance it is a clickbait. The rating is between 1 and 10 ðŸ§€

MouseTrap only activates when you are on Facebook, it does not scan or store any other website you visit.
