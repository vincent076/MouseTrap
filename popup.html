        <div class="panel">
          <p>Clickbait is a term for web content whose main goal is to get users to click on a link to go to a certain webpage. 
              
              Clickbait headlines typically aim to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make readers curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content.
              
              The techniques employed by the clickbait authors presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead using eye-catching headlines that included exaggerations of news events or sensationalism.

      <button class="accordion"> How it works</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Every 'hyperlink' that appears on your Facebook newsfeed will be analyzed. After this an algorithm does a prediction if the content is a clickbait or not. 
              
              The more ðŸ§€ you see, the higher the chance it is a clickbait. 
              
              MouseTrap only activates when you are on Facebook, it does not scan or store any other website you visit.

      <button class="accordion"> Behind the algorithm</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The predictions are done by an algorithm and by humans. The algorithm is fed by large sets of data qualified*by human as clickbait. These are scrapped from the kings of clickbait like Buzzfeed "Example Datasheet".  These large sets of data are analyzed for patterns. 
              
              ****2 graphs
              
              So if the hyperlinks contains certain words or word combinations there is a high chance of it being a clickbait.
              
              Next to the prediction based on the data sets the algorithm is and still will be trained by humans. They manually flag content as clickbait. This way it gets more accurate. You as a user also have influence on this by flagging content as clickbait.
